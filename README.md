Scripts for processing flow cytometry and FACS data

The overall strategy for using flow cytometry analysis is:

1. Put your `.fcs` files and a `SampleSheet.txt` in a folder.
2. Modify the script to point at that folder, or folders.
3. Run the script, gating when prompted. Modify the gating to gate
   on different parameters than those implemented.

`./src/` contains snippets of R code for functions and things.

To run the example script, download the dataset 
[from here](https://osf.io/ka5xx/).

You can see the example of this analysis [here](https://darachm.github.io/flow/Gresham_Lab_Flow_Cytometry_Analysis.html).

# paging

To make it so that you can view HTML pages, go to repository
settings and enable github pages and set it to master branch, docs
folder. Then put a link in here, if you want to.
